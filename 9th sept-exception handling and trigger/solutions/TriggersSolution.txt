1. initially create procedure:
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE check_salary (the_job VARCHAR2, the_salary  NUMBER) IS
minsal jobs.min_salary%type;  maxsal jobs.max_salary%type;
BEGIN
SELECT min_salary, max_salary 
INTO minsal, maxsal  
FROM jobs
WHERE job_id = UPPER(the_job);

IF the_salary NOT BETWEEN minsal AND maxsal 
THEN  
	RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20100,'Invalid salary $'||the_salary||'. '||
'Salaries for job '|| the_job ||' must be between $'|| minsal ||' and $' || maxsal);  END IF;
END;
/

Now,  create trigger on copy_emp table::

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER check_salary_trg  
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE 
OF job_id, salary  
ON copy_emp
FOR EACH ROW  
BEGIN
check_salary(:new.job_id, :new.salary);
END;
/

Test above trigger by updating salary in copy_emp table to 8000 for job_id MK_MAN. (As an output you should get an error for salary)
begin
  update copy_emp
  set salary = 8000
  where job_id='MK_MAN';
end;
/


2.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER delete_emp_trg  
BEFORE DELETE 
ON copy_emp

DECLARE
the_day VARCHAR2(3) := TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'DY');
the_hour number := TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'HH24'));  

BEGIN
IF (the_hour BETWEEN 9 AND 18) 
	AND 
	(the_day NOT IN ('SAT','SUN')) 
 THEN  
RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20150,
'Employee records cannot be deleted during the week 9am and 6pm');
END IF;
END;
/

Now, try deleting employee from copy_emp

begin
  delete from copy_emp
  where employee_id =206 ;
end;
/
Now try deleteing::

Ouput::  this should be the error
